# format, e.g. converting a project from a legacy project file to SDK-style
# which is intended to be immutable. There are typically also more files
# generated with a `.old` file extension or appended with a `-Backup` suffix
# found in the same directory as the project file.
# Only keep these files if there are no plans to upgrade all projects
# in a solution or if you still want to port the code back to an older
# platform; else it is recommended to delete these files.
